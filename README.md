Gut Microbiome Data Science Project

In this project, we identity significant bacterial groups that were most affected by food intake (avocados, broccoli, walnuts, almonds, etc). We then create machine learning models that predict food intake from changes in bacterial composition. 



1. Data Preprocessing 


2. Statistical Testing


3. Model Development
